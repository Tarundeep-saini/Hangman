# Hangman
 Made using React and Typescript.
 
A very simple Hangman Game. 

There is no CSS applied in this project.

I made this project to get started with Typescript.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd Hangman
```
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```
